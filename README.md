# resume-template

Lightweight resume template designed and developed this page back in 2016, inspired by [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

I'm re-uploading this on GitHub as there were many requests of sharing and re-using this template.


## License

You can use this template with a free of charge to make your own resume.

However, please make sure to mention me and AwesomeCV at the bottom of the page.
